Little python utilities to send HID command to my keyboards and mouse.

As the repo name implies, the original idea was to have tools to
communicate with my keyboards running QMK.

It somewhat changed. Python is good enough for now. And the Glorious
 Model O mouse happens to have leds, another alternative for visual
notification. The mouse usage leds became a possibility when I decide
to participate in a group buy for a led less keyboard ;-)

Enjoy the code and treat it as a simple example.
